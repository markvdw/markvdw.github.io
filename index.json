[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, researching machine learning, and a Tutorial Fellow at Hertford College.\nTogether with my research group, I work on three central questions:\nHow do we find general patterns that allow generalization beyond the training set, without humans manually encoding them? (Equivariance, causality, continual learning\u0026hellip;) How can we create neurons that automatically assemble their connectivity structure (architecture), while minimising the computational costs of the network as a whole? (Generalisation bounds, Bayesian model selection, MDL, meta-learning) How do we interact with the environment, while avoiding risk but learning as quickly as possible? (Bayesian optimisation, foundation models for industrial applications e.g. chemistry) These improvements are relevant for both small-data statistics (Gaussian processes), and large-data machine learning (neural networks). A wide range of research topics contribute towards these improvements, such as invariance, Bayesian inference, causality, meta-learning, local learning rules and generative modelling. My work has been presented at the leading machine learning conferences (e.g. NeurIPS and ICML), and includes a best paper award.\nSee my Research Overview page for more details on my research interests.\nFigure: Learning rotationally equivariant filter structure starting from a fully-connected structure. Note how the rotation of the filters increases as it learns the equivariant structure [paper]. Working with me I will have spaces for a small number (~2) of PhD students a year in the next few years. I am looking for people with a strong academic background (particularly strong mathematical skills) who are keen to work on topics that are aligned with my interests. I have written up some tips and guidelines for applying, which I recommend you read before getting in touch or submitting your application.\nAcademic or Industrial Collaborations I am also interested in applied problems, and am keen to collaborate. While my research overview gives a more complete picture of topics, I wanted to give a special mention to problems where 1) signal needs to be distinguished from noise, 2) knowledge needs to be encoded into the model, or 3) data is scarce, or needs to be acquired intelligently. Tools like (deep) Gaussian processes can make a difference here, and recent developments have provided new capabilities of dealing with higher-dimensional inputs or large datasets. Current ongoing collaborations include tailored Bayesian optimisation models for biomolecular design or optimisation of chemical processes.\nIf you have a problem that fits these descriptions, please do get in touch. Collaborations can range from publishing case-studies or datasets which can serve as a community benchmark, to consulting, to methods research.\nAbout Before starting at Oxford, I spent several great years at Imperial College London as a senior lecturer (associate professor). Before that, I worked in industry with Dr James Hensman for two years on data-driven decision making. I did my PhD in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, working with Prof. Carl Rasmussen, and completing my thesis in 2017. I was funded by the EPSRC and awarded a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for my final year. During my PhD, I occasionally worked as a machine learning consultant, and I also spent a few months as a visiting researcher at Google in Mountain View, CA. I moved to the UK from the Netherlands for my undergraduate degree in Engineering.\n","date":1641945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1641945600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Research

Automatic Machine Learning: Methods are too brittle, and require human design and oversight. Uncertainty quantification and decision making: Uncertainty tells us when risks are worth taking. Improvements in these areas would benefit the full spectrum of applications: from tasks with small amounts of data where eliminating noise is important, to high-dimensional large-data settings where neural networks are applied to natural data like images.\nApproaches from statistics can help to improve these three areas, e.g. Bayesian modelling. Bayesian modelling is well-known for helping with quantifying uncertainty. This is important for decision making, since risk needs to be taken into account. If a self-driving car is 5% sure the road ahead is blocked, it can slow down to gain more information, or perform evasive action. If a \u0026ldquo;best guess\u0026rdquo; is given of \u0026ldquo;not blocked\u0026rdquo;, the consequences can be catastrophic. Bayesian deep learning aims to get better uncertainty estimates, and we do work on this.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;m more excited about an underappreciated ability of the Bayesian framework: automatic inductive bias selection. By developing this ability in neural networks, the design of network architecture could be automated. Deep learning would be much more practical if humans wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to make a multitude of design choices, like how many layers are needed, how wide they should be, their convolutional structure, and so on. Currently, these choices are made by cross-validation, which is basically trial-and-error where different versions of the network are trained from scratch. The Bayesian approach provides a single objective function that can be optimised to find architecture and weights at the same time. The long-term goal for this line of research, is to be able to determine the connectivity structure of neurons (because this is what architecture is), in a single training run of the network. This would vastly simplify network design.\nAnother hypothesis in the ML community is that simply scaling models to be larger will solve the three problems mentioned above, rather than improving training procedures. Approaches like meta-learning and large language models like GPT-3 push in this direction. This brings up its own interesting open questions that statistical reasoning can contribute to: What tasks and datasets should be used? Can knowledge about the mathematics of inference inform architecture design? How should methods be evaluated? These are certainly also interesting questions to investigate.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not completely sure what approach I would bet on. I certainly follow developments in meta-learning and large models carefully. If the answer to this was clear, this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be research. Luckily, there are interesting questions to investigate in both directions.\nResearch Highlights To give a more concrete idea of research we have done, here are some projects and papers roughly grouped together in themes. These projects were done together with collaborators and students, so do look at the papers themselves.\nCausality \u0026amp; Bayesian Model Selection This is early work, but I\u0026rsquo;m excited about it. At the NeurIPS 2022 \u0026ldquo;Causal ML for Impact\u0026rdquo; workshop we presented our paper on Causal Discovery using Marginal Likelihood. This fits within our theme of using Bayesian model selection for many things. We straightforwardly use Bayesian model selection to discover causal direction in bivariate datsets. Simple principles lead to a method that performs very well compared to existing methods.\nThe appeal of investigating relationships between Bayesian inference and causality is that it may provide a guide to developing methods in more complex scenarios, like causal representation learning.\n(Do get in touch if you want to discuss thoughts on this work, any possible issues, or suggested benchmarks.)\nLearning invariances Invariance and equivariance are very common inductive biases, with the ubiquitous convolutional layer being the most common example. When designing architectures, humans currently choose how many convolutional layers to use, together with parameters like filter size. Often these choices are made with a laborious trial-and-error procedure (cross-validation). To make the number of choices even larger, other types of convolutional layers have been developed in recent years, which help generalisation across different scales and rotations. The optimal inductive bias varies by problem and dataset, so it would be nice if we had an automatic procedure for determining these.\nWe are developing methods that allow weights and architecture to be learned at the same time, by optimising a single objective function. In our paper Learning Invariances using the Marginal Likelihood we expressed invariances as data augmentations, and learned the correct data augmentation parameters through backprop with a single optimisation run. The objective function was derived from the principles of Bayesian model selection1.\nThe final invariance can be visualised by looking at the samples that the data augmentation procedure generates. Samples generated for a particular input image visualise which transformations are seen as not changing the label (see figure below).\nFigure: Samples describing the learned invariance for some MNIST digits (squares). The method becomes insensitive to local rotations, shears, and rotations. Overall, this procedure is a lot more convenient than training a model many times in a cross-validated grid search over the data augmentation parameters. What really shows that invariances are truly learned here, is that if you apply the same method to a dataset with different characteristics, a different invariance is learned. The same exact method that worked well on MNIST would learn almost full rotational invariance for rotated MNIST (see paper for results). Following the normal procedure, the cross-validated grid search would have to be performed again!\nThe method above was based on Gaussian processes, and we since have been working on neural network equivalents which learn different kinds of equivariant tied weights. Our 2022 UAI paper provided some nice GIFs of different kinds of convolutional structure being learned together with weights (see figure below).\nFigure: Learning rotationally equivariant filter structure starting from full connectivity. Note how the rotation of the filters increases as it learns the equivariant structure. What is particularly exciting is that we have been making steady progress towards making this work in deep neural networks. Approximations to the marginal likelihood that only considered the last layer were partially successful, while modifications of full-network Laplace approximations actually worked for ResNets.\nWhat are the limitations?\nThe current method is still a bit cumbersome. Our goal is to make model selection a universally applicable tool that makes hyperparameter tuning as easy as learning weights. You need to specify a solution space of invariances, from which the correct invariance is picked. All machine learning methods need to parameterise their solution space, but so far we have only parameterised simple ones like the space of distributions on affine transformations, and local deformations. We would like to be able to learn all hyperparameters that currently need to be adjusted in neural networks (e.g. how many neurons to use, or other architectural properties). There is plenty of more to do!\nAccurate and Automatic Gaussian process approximations We also do nitty-gritty research to make Gaussian processes (a model that is also common in statistics) work really well. One neat property of GPs is that there are principles for selecting all their free parameters. In principle, this means that humans aren\u0026rsquo;t needed in the loop to train them.\nUnfortunately, to reduce computational complexity, approximations need to be introduced. These often introduce free parameters again, which then means that a human has to intervene to ensure that the quality of the approximation is acceptable. This defeats part of the point! We improved two GP approximations (variational and conjugate gradient) by providing:\nautomatic procedures for selecting approximation parameters, and mathematical guarantees on the quality of the solution. This helps the methods give solutions in a more computationally efficient manner, while also making them more accurate. These methods help give predictions that you can really trust.\nSee:\nConvergence of Sparse Variational Inference in Gaussian Process Regression (or the shorter conference version) Tighter Bounds on the Log Marginal Likelihood of Gaussian Process Regression Using Conjugate Gradients In the search for faster GP approximations, I have also worked on variational bounds that do not require matrix inverses to be computed. While the maths works, getting the method to optimise quickly enough for it to actually provide a practical benefit is still difficult. I do think the results are neat, and that there is a lot more to be looked into here.\nDeep Gaussian processes Why is accurate Gaussian process inference important? Well, apart from GPs being useful for noisy and/or low-data tasks where quantifying uncertainty is important2, GPs are also a different representation of a neural network layer. It seems that there are advantages in terms of the quality of approximate Bayesian inference when representing a layer as a GP rather than with weights. One key research question is whether thinking about neural network layers as GPs can help bring the benefits of Bayesian inference (uncertainty and automatic model selection) to deep neural networks.\nThe evidence of this comes from the very first papers on deep GPs by Damianou \u0026amp; Lawrence, where the marginal likelihood estimate was already used for model selection. Simple inference methods keep this property, even as deep GP models become more complex.\nTechniques that accomplish similar things for neural networks are only now being developed. However, in some ways the approaches in deep GPs are simpler and easier, even if they are computationally expensive. I think that there is a significant opportunity for both classes of models to benefit from each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths. Deep links between deep GPs and deep neural networks are becoming clearer, and can provide a concrete way to get the best of both worlds.\nCapsules I do believe that good model structure is the most important property for good performance. When I first heard Geoff Hinton\u0026rsquo;s talk about capsule networks, I was very intrigued by the inductive bias specified by the network alone. In addition, there seems to be a lot of probabilistic inspiration behind the routing algorithm.\nTogether with Lewis Smith et al, we attempted to make a fully probabilistic formulation of capsule networks, which would allow routing to be derived directly from inference. Although our practical success was limited, the project did provide a lot of insight. I do still believe in the idea behind capsules and their link to probabilistic inference.

As a consequence, the generalisation ability of kernel methods depends strongly on the choice of kernel. In this work, we use invariances to create kernels with sophisticated inductive biases. Crucially, we show how the marginal likelihood from the Gaussian process framework can be used to learn an appropriate invariance through backpropagation for a given dataset. I will also discuss some technical advances that were made along the way, notably the ability to learn using only unbiased evaluations of the kernel function.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Invariances using the Marginal Likelihood","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clare Lyle","Lisa Schut","Robin Ru","Yarin Gal","Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"1f1776ab57255c69535cf3d29bba2d11","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/lyle-2020-trainingspeed/","publishdate":"2025-07-23T20:19:13.134179Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lyle-2020-trainingspeed/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"A Bayesian Perspective on Training Speed and Model Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk","Vincent Dutordoir","ST John","Artem Artemev","Vincent Adam","James Hensman"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"e4a7c045bae89c7c17b3a587cea24593","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/vdw-2020-framework/","publishdate":"2025-07-23T20:19:13.11758Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vdw-2020-framework/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"A Framework for Interdomain and Multioutput Gaussian Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Dutordoir","Mark van der Wilk","Artem Artemev","James Hensman"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"2e818e1d57ac7022931ef61e9ce4e7db","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/dutordoir-2020-dcgp/","publishdate":"2025-07-23T20:19:13.114795Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dutordoir-2020-dcgp/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Image Classification with Deep Convolutional Gaussian Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lewis Smith","Lisa Schut","Yarin Gal","Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"8561ee2324a7966da8c07c3101f9ce1d","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/smith-2020-capsules/","publishdate":"2025-07-23T20:19:13.131426Z","relpermalink":"/publication/smith-2020-capsules/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Capsule Networks -- A Probabilistic Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David R.
