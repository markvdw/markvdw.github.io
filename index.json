Our approach performs variational inference over both the system states and the transition function. We exploit Markov structure in the true posterior, as well as an inducing point approximation to achieve linear time complexity in the length of the time series. Contrary to previous approaches, no Monte Carlo sampling is required: inference is cast as a deterministic optimisation problem. In a number of experiments, we demonstrate the ability to model non- linear dynamics in the presence of both process and observation noise as well as to impute missing information (e.g. velocities from raw positions through time), to de-noise, and to estimate the underlying dimensionality of the system. Finally, we also introduce a closed-form method for multi-step prediction, and a novel criterion for assessing the quality of our approximate posterior.","tags":[],"title":"Closed-form Inference and Prediction in Gaussian Process State-Space Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk","Carl Edward Rasmussen","James Hensman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1504724238,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504724238,"objectID":"8e7a0481aea60d546b8536dcd76eea7e","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/convolutional-gp/","publishdate":"2017-09-06T18:57:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/convolutional-gp/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a practical way of introducing convolutional structure into Gaussian processes, making them more suited to high-dimensional inputs like images.

We investigate several variations of the convolutional kernel, and apply it to MNIST and CIFAR-10, where we obtain significant improvements over existing Gaussian process models.

They have been applied to both regression and non-linear dimensionality reduction, and offer desirable properties such as uncertainty estimates, robustness to over-fitting, and principled ways for tuning hyper-parameters. However the scalability of these models to big datasets remains an active topic of research. We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of variational inference for sparse GP regression and latent variable models that allows for an efficient distributed algo- rithm. This is done by exploiting the decoupling of the data given the inducing points to re-formulate the evidence lower bound in a Map-Reduce setting. We show that the inference scales well with data and computational resources, while preserving a balanced distribution of the load among the nodes. We further demonstrate the utility in scaling Gaussian processes to big data. We show that GP performance improves with increasing amounts of data in regression (on flight data with 2 million records) and latent variable modelling (on MNIST). The results show that GPs perform better than many common models often used for big data.","tags":[],"title":"Distributed Variational Inference in Sparse Gaussian Process Regression and Latent Variable Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yarin Gal","Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1412017038,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412017038,"objectID":"9f511124c81ab3ba1c6c598d4eb04973","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/gentle-tutorial/","publishdate":"2014-09-29T18:57:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gentle-tutorial/","section":"publication","summary":"In this tutorial we explain the inference procedures developed for the sparse Gaussian process (GP) regression and Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM). Due to page limit the derivation given in Titsias (2009) and Titsias \u0026 Lawrence (2010) is brief, hence getting a full picture of it requires collecting results from several different sources and a substantial amount of algebra to fill-in the gaps. Our main goal is thus to collect all the results and full derivations into one place to help speed up understanding this work. In doing so we present a re-parametrisation of the inference that allows it to be carried out in parallel. A secondary goal for this document is, therefore, to accompany our paper and open-source implementation of the parallel inference scheme for the models. We hope that this document will bridge the gap between the equations as implemented in code and those published in the original papers, in order to make it easier to extend existing work. We assume prior knowledge of Gaussian processes and variational inference, but we also include references for further reading where appropriate.","tags":[],"title":"Variational Inference in Sparse Gaussian Process Regression and Latent Variable Models - a Gentle Tutorial","type":"publication"}]
