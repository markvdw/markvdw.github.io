[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research In January 2020 I joined the Department of Computing at Imperial College London as a lecturer (assistant professor). My research works towards developing systems which learn to accomplish tasks through experience from interacting with the environment, with as little experience as possible. I aim to let the underlying principles of inference and learning guide my work, both from the point of view of developing practical methods from first principles, and from finding underlying principles in existing methods.\nMy research is motivated by reinforcement learning methods which use explicit predictive models of the world to plan behaviour. This approach improves data efficiency, as knowledge about the world generalises strongly to new situations. Learning good models of the world, with a reliable estimate of their own uncertainty, is crucial to the success of these methods. In addition, they need to be automatic, in the sense that they should not rely on human design or intervention as they learn.\nCurrently, the main component of my research is building better predictive models. In reinforcement learning / decision making applications, we require a) uncertainty estimates, for avoiding or taking calculated risks, and b) automatic adaptation with increasing data, as more experience is gained. Bayesian inference provides an elegant framework for representing uncertainty, and automating many aspects of the modelling process. Currently, I am interested in bringing the benefits of Bayesian inference to deep learning models, using Gaussian processes as a building block.\nMy work has been presented at the leading machine learning conferences (NeurIPS and ICML), including an oral presentation and a best paper award. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;m currently enthusiastic about our paper on learning what invariance should be used as an inductive bias for a particular dataset.\nWorking with me I will have spaces for a small number (~2) of PhD students a year in the next few years. I am looking for people with a strong academic background (particularly strong mathematical skills) who are keen to work on topics that are aligned with my interests (see below).\nA strong mathematical background is usually demonstrated by a first-class (or equivalent) degree in information or electrical engineering, physics, maths, or computer science. A background in e.g. linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimisation are particularly important. You can demonstrate alignment with my research interests with a short research statement that outlines 1) what problem you are interested in, 2) why this problem is interesting or important, and 3) what techniques you think will be useful or necessary for reaching your goals.\nTopics  Bayesian inference and approximations to it (variational inference, EP, MCMC, \u0026hellip;). Gaussian process models (deep GPs, GPSSM, GPLVM, \u0026hellip;) or their theoretical properties. Bayesian deep learning (inference over weights, using GPs as building blocks, \u0026hellip;). Neural networks / other models with invariance properties (e.g. rotation, scale, or more arbitrary) and learning invariances. Analysis of deep neural networks (infinite limits and GP relations). Model-based reinforcement learning. Differentially private machine learning. Connections between Bayesian inference and generalisation error bounds.  About Before starting at Imperial, I worked with James Hensman for two years as a machine learning researcher at PROWLER.io, a research-led startup aiming to solve a wide variety of decision making problems. I did my PhD in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, working with Carl Rasmussen, and completing my thesis in 2017. I was funded by the EPSRC and awarded a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for my final year. During my PhD, I occasionally worked as a machine learning consultant, and I also spent a few months as a visiting researcher at Google in Mountain View, CA. I moved to the UK from the Netherlands for my undergraduate degree in Engineering at Jesus College, University of Cambridge.\n Download my resumé. -- ","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Research In January 2020 I joined the Department of Computing at Imperial College London as a lecturer (assistant professor).

We show that approximate maximum likelihood learning of model parameters by maximising our lower bound retains many benefits of the sparse variational approach while reducing the bias introduced into hyperparameter learning. The basis of our bound is a more careful analysis of the log-determinant term appearing in the log marginal likelihood, as well as using the method of conjugate gradients to derive tight lower bounds on the term involving a quadratic form. Our approach is a step forward in unifying methods relying on lower bound maximisation (e.g. variational methods) and iterative approaches based on conjugate gradients for training Gaussian processes. In experiments, we show improved predictive performance with our model for a comparable amount of training time compared to other conjugate gradient based approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Tighter Bounds on the Log Marginal Likelihood of Gaussian Process Regression Using Conjugate Gradients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622649600,"objectID":"8ba08bda373301a5771202484257ca0e","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/reliable-training-of-gaussian-process-approximations/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/reliable-training-of-gaussian-process-approximations/","section":"event","summary":"How to select inducing inputs, and how this makes training sparse GPs much better.","tags":[],"title":"Reliable Training of Gaussian Process Approximations","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"Context This talk was given as part of a series where alumni of the group where I did my PhD were invited to return to discuss their research.

Gaussian processes (GPs) provide uncertainty estimates and a marginal likelihood objective, but their weak inductive biases lead to inferior accuracy. This has limited their applicability in certain tasks (e.g. image classification). We propose a translation insensitive convolutional kernel, which relaxes the translation invariance constraint imposed by previous convolutional GPs. We show how we can use the marginal likelihood to learn the degree of insensitivity. We also reformulate GP image-to-image convolutional mappings as multi-output GPs, leading to deep convolutional GPs. We show experimentally that our new kernel improves performance in both single-layer and deep models. We also demonstrate that our fully Bayesian approach improves on dropout-based Bayesian deep learning methods in terms of uncertainty and marginal likelihood estimates.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Image Classification with Deep Convolutional Gaussian Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592265600,"objectID":"aac2a99afb0dfaaaa49710beab430480","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/variational-gaussian-processes-without-matrix-inverses/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/variational-gaussian-processes-without-matrix-inverses/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Variational Gaussian Processes without Matrix Inverses","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591574400,"objectID":"1fcb602208c988fc924a4e59a3a03aff","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","section":"event","summary":"A tutorial on Bayesian model selection, and how it can be used to learn invariances using backprop.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Invariances using the Marginal Likelihood","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581897600,"objectID":"4c18add12979cbf05e72e53c41dc8460","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","section":"event","summary":"Kernels provide a powerful way of encoding assumptions about the class of functions that should be used for a particular learning problem.

Inference in this setting has either employed computationally intensive MCMC methods, or relied on factorisations of the variational posterior. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the factorisation between latent system states and transition function can lead to a miscalibrated posterior and to learning unnecessarily large noise terms. We eliminate this factorisation by explicitly modelling the dependence between state trajectories and the low-rank representation of our Gaussian process posterior. Samples of the latent states can then be tractably generated by conditioning on this representation. The method we obtain gives better predictive performance and more calibrated estimates of the transition function, yet maintains the same time and space complexities as mean-field methods.","tags":[],"title":"Overcoming Mean-Field Approximations in Recurrent Gaussian Process Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Burt","Carl Edward Rasmussen","Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620896936,"objectID":"c7391258d912362c54011419675fc404","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/burt-2019-rates/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T20:57:12.558479Z","relpermalink":"/publication/burt-2019-rates/","section":"publication","summary":"Excellent variational approximations to Gaussian process posteriors have been developed which avoid the $mathcalOłeft(N^3i̊ght)$ scaling with dataset size $N$. They reduce the computational cost to $mathcalOłeft(NM^2g̊ht)$, with $Młl N$ the number of inducing variables, which summarise the process. While the computational cost seems to be linear in $N$, the true complexity of the algorithm depends on how $M$ must increase to ensure a certain quality of approximation. We show that with high probability the KL divergence can be made arbitrarily small by growing $M$ more slowly than $N$. A particular case is that for regression with normally distributed inputs in D-dimensions with the Squared Exponential kernel, $M=mathcalO(łog^D N)$ suffices. Our results show that as datasets grow, Gaussian process posteriors can be approximated cheaply, and provide a concrete rule for how to increase $M$ in continual learning scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Rates of Convergence for Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
